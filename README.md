# LeetCode Solutions ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

This repository contains my solutions to various **LeetCode** problems written in **Python**.  
I'm using it to strengthen my understanding of **data structures and algorithms (DSA)** â€” exploring topics like:

- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Sorting & Searching  
- Dynamic Programming  

Each file includes clear, commented solutions with test cases where applicable.  
My goal is to build consistency and depth in problem-solving using clean, efficient Python code.
